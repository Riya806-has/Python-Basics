        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "    - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
        "     * Why Python Is Popular:\n",
        "       1. Easy to Learn and Use\n",
        "       2. Versatile and Multi-Paradigm\n",
        "       3.  Extensive Libraries and Frameworks\n",
        "       4. Large Community and Ecosystem\n",
        "       5. Cross-Platform Compatibility\n",
        "       6. Popular in Key Industries\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "    - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Instead of converting the whole program into machine code at once, the interpretor translates and runs one line at a time.\n",
        "     * Key Points:\n",
        "       1. Execution Line by Line\n",
        "       2. No Need for Compilation\n",
        "       3. Interactive Mode\n",
        "       4. Platform Independence\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "    - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning to the Python interpreter. These words are part of the language syntax and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "      * Examples of Python Keywords:\n",
        "       1. if, else, elif - Conditional statements\n",
        "       2. for, while, break, continue - Loops and control flow\n",
        "       3. def, return, lamda - Functions\n",
        "       4. True, False, None - Special constrants\n",
        "       5. class, try, except, finally, raise - Classes and exception handling\n",
        "       6. import, from, as - Modules and importing\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "    - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in most programming languages because they are reserved to perform specific functions in the code.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "    - Mutability in Python refers to whether or not an object's state (it's data/content) can be changed after it is created. These can be changed in place without changing their identity.\n",
        "     * Examples:\n",
        "       1. list\n",
        "       2. dict\n",
        "       3. set\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "    - In Python, the difference in mutability between lists and tuples comes down to design choice and intended use:\n",
        "        * Why Lists Are Mutable\n",
        "         1. Purpose: Lists are mean to store collections of items that may change - like adding, removing, or updating elements.\n",
        "         2. Implementation: Lists internally use a dynamic array structure, allowing in-place updates without needing to recreate the whole object.\n",
        "         3. Flexibility: Lists support operations like .append(), .remove(),\n",
        "          .sort(), etc., which modify the object.\n",
        "  *  Why Tuples Are Immutable\n",
        "              1. Purpose: Tuples are designed to represent fixed collection of items - like coordinates, dates, or constant settings.\n",
        "              2. Hashability: Being immutable allows tuples to be used as dictionary keys or elements in sets.\n",
        "              3. Safety: Prevents accidental modification of data that should remain constant.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Python?\n",
        "   - The difference between the == and is operators in Python lies in what they compare. The == operator compares the values of two objects for equality, while the is operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n",
        "       * == (Equality Operator):\n",
        "      >  It returns True if the values of the operands are equal. It checks for value equality.\n",
        "       * is (Identity Operator):\n",
        "   > It returns True if the operands refer to the same object. It checks for reference equality.\n",
        "8. What are logical Operators in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They return boolean values (True or False) based on the logic of the expressions.\n",
        "     * Python's 3 Logical Operators:\n",
        "        1.  and: Returns True if both operands are True, otherwise it returns False.\n",
        "        2. or: Returns True if at least one of the operands is True, and False only if both are False.\n",
        "        3. not: Returns the opposite boolean value of the operand. If the operand is True, it returns False, and vice versa.  \n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "    - Type casting in Python, also known as type conversion, refers to the process of changing the data type of a variable from one type to another. This is often necessary to perform operations that require specific data types or to ensure compatibility between different parts of a program.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "     -  The difference between implicit and explicit type casting are follows:\n",
        "       * Implicit type casting: This occurs automatically by the Python interpreter when performing certain operations. It usually happens when converting from a smaller data type to a larger data type to prevent data loss. For example, when adding an integer to a float, Python implicitly converts the integer to a float before performing the addition.\n",
        "       *  Explicit type casting: This is done manually by the programmer using built-in functions. It is used when you need to convert a value to a specific data type, even if it might result in data loss or errors. For instance, converting a float to an integer or a string to an integer.\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "     - Conditional statements in Python enable programs to execute different code blocks based on whether specific conditions are met. They are fundamental for creating dynamic and responsive programs that can adapt to varying situations and inputs. The primary purpose of conditional statements is to control the flow of execution in a program, allowing it to make decisions and perform actions accordingly.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "     - The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions.\n",
        "      *  For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "     -  The primary difference between a for loop and a while loop lies in how they control the iteration process. A for loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, and it iterates over a sequence or range. A while loop, repeats a block of code until a condition becomes false, making it suitable when the number of iterations is not predetermined.\n",
        "     *  Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n",
        "         *  For Loop:\n",
        "            1. Iterates over a sequence:\n",
        "             for loops are commonly used to iterate over collections like lists, strings, or ranges of numbers.\n",
        "          2. Known number of iterations:\n",
        "The number of times the loop will execute is typically defined at the beginning of the loop.\n",
        "          3. Example:\n",
        "for i in range(5): print(i) will print numbers from 0 to 4, a fixed number of times.      \n",
        "         * While Loop:\n",
        "            1. Condition-based iteration: while loops repeat as long as a condition remains true.\n",
        "            2. Unknown number of iterations: The number of iterations is not fixed and depends on the condition.\n",
        "            3. Example: count = 0; [30]while count < 5: print(count); [31, 32, 33]count += 1 will print numbers from 0 to 4 until count is no longer less than 5.\n",
        "            4. Potential for infinite loops: If the condition in a while loop is never met or becomes permanently true, the loop can run indefinitely, leading to an \"infinite loop\".\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "     - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in scenarios where the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition that changes dynamically during execution.         "
